Native Rendering: 
React: The React-like JavaScript code developers write for their React Native apps
JS Thread: The app code is converted into a single JS bundle or file. React Native executes this code in a special thread to determine what it needs to render or invoke.
UI Thread: This thread receives actions to run natively. It can include rendering native components, like a <Button />. It can also return data, requested by the JS thread, like sensor data.
Native: The native operating system actually renders the native component for a <Button /> on the phone.
